# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This is my first time using Vite. The set-up was very easy and I would reccomend it.

This project has been created for class. Some of the content is leftover from when I created the React project, such as the images for React and Vite. The content regarding the short story, the Tortoise and the Hare, has been added by me, Meera Bhola.
